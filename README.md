# challenge-weekone

## Description

An on-the-job ticket challenge involving improving the accessibility of starter code with the inclusion of a well-formatted README.md file to demonstrate an understanding of what makes an HTML page accessible for screen readers and to highlight a comprehension of 'Markdown' in creating a README.md file.

## Installation

Follow the github pages link included below:


Or, use your favourite code editor to read, edit and view the webpage through right-clicking index.html and clicking 'open in browser'.

## Usage

Can be used as an example of an HTML file formatted for accessbility by using semantic elements and alt attributes.

Also, by accessing the original HTML file on https://github.com/fkatwink/challenge-weekone, user can compare the index.html with the final version by downloading a screen reader and observing the quality first-hand.
